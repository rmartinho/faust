        <p>
          FAUST is a website generator for visualizing unit stats for
          <em>Rome:&nbsp;Total&nbsp;War</em> mods. It supports mods for the
          original <em>Rome:&nbsp;Total&nbsp;War</em> as well as
          <em>Total&nbsp;War:&nbsp;Rome&nbsp;Remastered</em>, and there is also
          some support for <em>Medieval&nbsp;II:&nbsp;Total&nbsp;War</em> mods.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to see what that looks like, take a look at one of these

          You can download
          <a href="https://github.com/rmartinho/faust/releases/latest"
            >the latest version</a
          >
          of FAUST from the releases page. FAUST works on multiple operating
          systems, so choose the one that matches yours and download the
          corresponding zip file. Inside you will find an executable file, a
          README with instructions, and a file describing what&rsquo;s changed
          from previous versions.

      <details name="questions">
        <summary role="button">How do I use FAUST?</summary>
        <p>
          Once you have downloaded the latest release for your operating system,
          you need to prepare a manifest. The manifest is a file that describes
          how you want to process your mod. Inside the mod folder, create a
          folder named
          <code>faust</code>. This is, next to the <code>data</code> folder, not
          inside it. All of the FAUST-specific files will go in that folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the <code>faust</code> folder, create a text file named
          <code>faust.yml</code>. This will be your manifest file. This file
          will be written in YAML syntax. Don&rsquo;t worry if you&rsquo;re not
          familiar with that; it should be quite straighforward once you see
          examples. Here&rsquo;s an example of a simple manifest.
        </p>

        <pre>
id: rome_partial_war
name: "Rome: Partial War"
game: original</pre
        >

        <p>
          A manifest like this first declares an ID for the mod, which will be
          used internally and also in URL. Then it declares the display name of
          the mod. This will be shown in page content and page titles. And
          lastly, it defines which game the mod is for, so FAUST knows how to
          process the mod folder. The three possibilities are
          <code>original</code>, <code>remastered</code>, and
          <code>medieval2</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more options available but they are optional and you may or
          may not need to use them. These three are all that is required. If you
          want to see what other options are available, you can scroll down to
          that section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have a manifest file, you still need one more thing: a banner
          image to represent your mod. This is just an image file named
          <code>banner.png</code> next to the manifest file. This image can be
          whatever you want, but you should know that ir will be displayed as a
          512x256 image.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you have everything ready, it&rsquo;s time to launch FAUST.
          FAUST is a command-line application, but the Windows version has some
          niceties that make it unnecessary to mess with the command-line
          directly.
        </p>
        <details name="run-modes" open>
          <summary role="group">Easy mode</summary>
          <p>
            If you&rsquo;re on Windows, you can just double-click the executable
            file and it will show a dialog for you to select your manifest file.
            Just navigate to the foldee where you created it earlier and select
            it.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details name="run-modes">
          <summary role="group">Advanced mode</summary>
          <p>
            If you are not on Windows, or you prefer to use the command-line
            directly, you can launch the <code>faust</code> executable passing
            the path to manifest as an argument. Further down this document you
            can find more details on the command-line options that are
            available.
          </p>
        </details>
        <p>
          Once you launched FAUST with your manifest file, you will see some
          progress displayed. If everything goes well, FAUST will read in the
          files from your mod folder, build a catalog of all the factions and
          units, and then write out a website that displays all of that
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you launched FAUST in easy mode, or if you used the
          <code>-s</code> command-line option, FAUST will then start a local web
          server so that you can browse the website it generated. The address
          will be copied to your clipboard, so you can just paste it in your
          browser&rsquo;s address bar.
        </p>

      <details name="questions">
        <summary role="button">What are the advanced manifest options?</summary>
        <p>
          Here is a list of all of the options supported in the manifest. You

          <dd>
            <p>
              <strong>Required.</strong> The mod ID. This is used internally in
              scripts and in the URLs.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>id: rome</pre>

              <strong>Required.</strong> The mod&rsquo;s display name. This is
              used in the generated website as the page title.

            <h6>Example</h6>

          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> Which game this mod is for. This is used to let
              FAUST know how to process the mod files.

          </dd>

          <dt><code>campaign</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional</em> The campaign folder to process. Currently FAUST
              only supports cataloguing one campaign. This option lets you
              specify the name of the campaign folder that should be processed.
              By default, the following folder names are tried in order:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><code>imperial_campaign</code></li>
              <li><code>barbarian_invasian</code></li>
              <li><code>alexander</code></li>
            </ol>
            <aside>
              Note: This option is likely to be changed or removed in a future
              update.
            </aside>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>campaign: sons_of_mars</pre>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>banner</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> The banner image file. This can be an absolute
              path or relative to the manifest folder. By default FAUST assumes
              the banner is a file named <code>banner.png</code>
              in the manifest folder.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>banner: rome.tga</pre>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>dir</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> The mod folder. This can be an absolute path or
              relative to the manifest folder. This is useful if you want to
              keep the manifest outside of the mod folder. By default FAUST
              assumes the manifest folder is at the root of the mod folder.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>dir: ../mod</pre>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>exclude</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> Which factions to exclude when generating the
              site. Sometimes mods need to keep factions that are not used, e.g.
              to avoid some crashes. In order to exclude those factions from the
              catalog, you can list those unused factions with this option in
              the manifest. By default all factions that have units are
              included.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>
exclude:
  - gauls
  - britons
  - germans</pre
            >
          </dd>

          <dt><code>aliases</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> Faction ID aliases. Sometimes mods reuse the
              base game faction IDs but the factions are changed to something
              completely different. Since the faction IDs are used in URLs, it
              might be confusing to see those unrelated faction IDs. In order to
              improve this, you can specify aliases that will be used the URLs
              instead of the internal faction IDs. By default, no aliases are
              used.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>
aliases:
  britannia: britons
  germania: germans</pre
            >
          </dd>

          <dt><code>eras</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> Many mods have units that become available only
              after certain events occur. The most notable example is the Marian
              reforms in the base game. The mod files don't have an explicit
              concept of eras like this, but you can define them yourself with
              this option. By default, no eras are defined.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>
eras:
  pre_marian:
    name: "Before the Marian reforms"
    major_event:
      marian_reforms: false
  post_marian:
    name: "After the Marian reforms"
    major_event:
      marian_reforms: true</pre
            >
            <p>
              Additionally, you should create a folder named
              <code>eras</code> in the manifest folder, and create two image
              files for each era in it: one to use when the era is selected, and
              one to use when the era is not selected. For the example above,
              the files would be named as follows.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><code>pre_marian-on.png</code></li>
              <li><code>pre_marian-off.png</code></li>
              <li><code>post_marian-on.png</code></li>
              <li><code>post_marian-off.png</code></li>
            </ol>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>unit_info_images</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> Whether to use images from
              <code>ui/unit_info</code> instead of <code>ui/unit</code>. Use
              this option if the mod has small unit card images (e.g. most mods
              for the original game) that end up looking blurry at the scale
              used in the site. This will instead use the unit info images which
              are larger. By default, FAUST will use unit card images for
              <code>remastered</code> mods, and unit info images for others.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>unit_info_images: true</pre>
          </dd>

          <dt><code>speed</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> Whether to estimate speeds. If `true`, FAUST will
              perform a speed estimation based on the base game skeleton animations
              and display it. If the estimation is off, you can use the `speeds` option
              to directly provide each skeleton&rsquo;s speed. By default, no speed
              estimates are done.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>
speed: true</pre
            >
          </dd>

          <dt><code>speeds</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> Speed mapping. Currently the unit move speeds
              are an estimation based on the base game skeleton animations. Each
              skeleton is internally mapped to a hardcoded speed. This option
              exists to override this, in case there are different skeletons. If
              specified, `speed` is set to true.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>
speeds:
  fs_dagger: 30
  fs_semi_fast_dagger: 32</pre
            >
          </dd>

          <dt><code>pools</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> Mercenary pool information. The game doesn't
              have any text strings for the mercenary pools; this option lets
              you specify names for the mercenary pools to be displayed in the
              mercenaries page. This is just a list of names for the pools in
              the same order as in <code>descr_mercenaries.txt</code>. By
              default, the internal pool IDs are used. 
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>
pools:
  - "Britannia"
  - "Germania"
  - "Eastern Europe"
  - "Steppes"
  - "Central Europe"
  - "Gaul"</pre
            >
          </dd>

          <dt><code>aors</code></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              <em>Optional.</em> Area of recruitment information. The game
              doesn't have any text strings for areas of recruitment; like
              <code>pools</code> above, this option lets you specify names for
              the areas of recruitment to be displayed in the regional units
              pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is also a list of names in order. However, because areas of
              recruitment have no explicit realization in the game (they're
              defined with the hidden resources system), this order is
              arbitrary, but it's fixed for each mod. You can generate the site
              once and look in <code>images/&lt;mod-id&gt;/aors</code>
              to see what the correct order is. By default, AORs have no
              associated names.
            </p>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <pre>
aors:
